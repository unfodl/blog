# Unfolding new technologies

Hi, I'm Marco. I'm passionate about emerging technologies with the potential to transform the world. I believe technology can improve the lives of millions, but this impact depends on people truly understanding both its possibilities and its limitations â€” and recognizing that meaningful implementation takes time.

I created this blog as a space to document and share the technologies I explore, starting with the field I've been involved in for the past few years: blockchain. Here, I break down implementation processes with the goal of deepening my own understanding, while sharing insights with others. This journey also helps me refine my ability to analyze, explain, and work with these transformative technologies.
